# MVP

//what city people are in needs to be on the profile
//to use devise, see:
https://github.com/plataformatec/devise

## Sign up
  * create a profile
  * set questions to levels of negotiability
  * set privacy things -- everything is public or private
  * review the information

## Connect with people
  * connect with facebook to see which friends are on it without even signing up - show just name and picture
  * you are automatically connected to your facebook friends if you create a profile and give FB permission
  * you can invite people by e-mail and be automatically connected when they sign up -- once they accept your invitation and create a profile
  * optionally connect to facebook to autopopulate

## Compare profiles
  * if your profile is 80% filled out, can look at profiles of other people who meet same requirement
    * basic info if you don't know them at all: (first name, last initial, what you have in common, neighborhood, some of their interests)
    * you can look at an abridged profile if you are within a certain number of degrees of separation - also see who you have in common
    *
  * if your profile is 100% filled out, can compare to 1 - 7 other people at a time-- hypothetical groups
  * once you are set on a group, send out a request with the details, see if they want to talk about next steps
  * once you are an official group, and everyone has agreed, then everyone can see each other's information -- can be in multiple official groups at a time
  * a solidified group can have empty spaces and look at other people still-- people will be suggested based on how many connections they have, then how many values they share
  * if one of the people in the group won't work out, you can swap in other people

## Later, Maybe, and Stretch:
  * a page with resources, (bylaw) templates to form your own co-op, professionals, etc
  * optional donation? maybe one day pay wall
  * discounts/rewards program
  * matching people with properties
  * matching people to existing cooperatives
  * messaging
