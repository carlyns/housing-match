MVP
0.  connect with facebook to see which friends are on it without even signing up - show just name and picture
1.  have people create profiles, optionally connect to facebook to autopopulate -- you can set privacy things -- everything is public or private
2.  you are automatically connected to your facebook friends -- you can invite people by e-mail and be automatically connected when they sign up -- once they accept your invitation and create a profile
3.  compare profiles to each other if you have it 80% filled out; shows different people and you can add them to a group (if you're 100% complete) and see what it looks like and name the group
4.  once you are an official group, and everyone has agreed, then everyone can see each other's information -- can be in multiple official groups at a time


you can see who of your network has already taken this quiz/made a profile
fill out the profile - negotiable vs non negotiable
review the information
invite friends - social media button or something - maybe through facebook, maybe through e-mail
a way to view group info - a way to look at hypothetical groups and how they work or don't
once you are set on a group, send out a request with the details, see if they want to talk about next steps - have a group meeting or whatever - and once everyone is solidified, they can either have empty spaces (for which other people will be suggested) or not
if one of the people in the group won't work out, you can swap in other people
//what city people are in needs to be on the profile

is there a browse feature for people?
  it shows your connections who have taken this quiz
  you can look at an abridged profile if you are within a certain number of degrees of separation
  basic info if you don't know them at all: (first name, last initial, what you have in common, neighborhood, some of their interests)
  who you have in common-- degrees of connection
  second layer shows that you're connected
  third layer is if you've completed a profile

also:
  a page with resources, (bylaw) templates to form your own co-op, professionals, etc
  optional donation? maybe one day pay wall
  discounts/rewards program
  matching people with properties
  matching people to existing cooperatives
  messaging
